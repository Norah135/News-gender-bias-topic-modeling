Gender Bias in Regional News: A Topic Modeling Analysis

Introduction
Gender bias is a pervasive societal issue that permeates various aspects of our lives, with far-reaching implications, particularly in information dissemination. News articles, as a primary source of information, are not immune to gender bias, which can subtly influence language, perspectives, and the overall framing of stories. Addressing gender bias is essential for fostering inclusivity and ensuring fair representation within the media landscape. Biased language and narratives have the potential to perpetuate stereotypes, reinforce societal norms, and contribute to unequal power dynamics.

Project Goal:
In this project, our aim is to shed light on gender bias within news articles from Pakistan and Malaysia by employing topic modeling techniques. We seek to explore and identify bias in gender representations across different topics in country-specific news. The analysis is structured into two stages:

Prevalence of Gender within Individual Articles:

1- In the first stage, we examine the prevalence of each gender within individual news articles across various topics.
Gender Representation in Topics:

2- The second stage involves identifying how men and women are presented in news articles covering different topics.

Why This Matters:
Understanding the nuances of gender bias in news reporting is crucial for creating awareness, fostering informed discussions, and advocating for fair and unbiased media representation.
Feel free to explore our findings, methodologies, and contribute to this ongoing effort to promote fair and equitable reporting.
